# Home Monitoring System

The Home Monitoring System project aims to promote the efficient use of electrical energy in households by encouraging the implementation of devices that can monitor and control energy consumption. To achieve this, we have created a comprehensive solution based on NodeMCU ESP8266 that can measure the energy usage of appliances, detect the presence of LP gas, monitor temperature, and control lighting through a photoresistor. This system is designed to transform an ordinary home into a smart home, empowering users to make informed decisions about their electricity consumption and prevent potential risks.

## Components Integrated into the Project

- **NodeMCU (esp8266):** The core module for IoT communication and control.
- **Relay Module:** Used for controlling electrical appliances.
- **Light-Dependent Resistor (GL55):** Enables light control for energy-efficient lighting.
- **Temperature Sensor (ds18b20):** Monitors the temperature in the home.
- **Gas Sensor (MQ-2):** Detects the presence of LP gas, enhancing safety.
- **LED Light:** Used for controlling lighting and adding automation to the home.

This repository serves as a platform for sharing the project's source code, schematics, and relevant documentation. Whether you are a developer, an electronics enthusiast, or someone interested in energy-efficient technologies, you'll find valuable resources here to explore and implement the Home Monitoring System in your own home.
